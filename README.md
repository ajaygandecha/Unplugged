With the typical social media user spending an average of 2.4 hours a day—and teenagers nearly doubling that at 4.8 hours—new generations dedicate a significant portion of their time to consuming random content, much of which has little impact on their lives. Many try to delete social media apps entirely, but doing so often means disconnecting from friends and family. In addition, since many student organizations on college campuses use social media to share important news and upcoming events, disconnecting entirely from social media leaves students entirely out of the loop.

That's were **Unplugged** comes in! Unplugged offers an alternative way to interact with social media, enabling users to see posts from only those they care about across their various social media accounts. Unplugged offers many ways for users to customize their feed, enabling them to stay connected with friends, family, and their communities without being subjected to advertisements, social media algorithms, and unsolicited content.
